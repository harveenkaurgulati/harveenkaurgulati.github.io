## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Lonza (September 2022 - Present)**
Acquired proficiency in SQL, data mining, meticulous data analysis, statistical analysis, and adept database querying and retrieval through following tasks:
- Led the CPV (continued process verification) of 25+ batches of commercial products using DataMart and Statistica.
- Conducted ad-hoc analyses to identify the causes of any deviation, resulting in improved operational efficiency and cost savings. 
- Standardised ETL processes and tools to automate data extraction and reporting for a new product.


**Data Scientist @ AkzoNobel (July 2021 - Jun 2022)**
Acquired proficiency in R language, data cleaning, data wrangling, data visualization and predictive modelling through following activities:
- Cleaned and processed a large database containing decades worth of data on paints and coatings. 
- Established the standard performance of products via LOWESS regression model. Visualised the data in Power BI and R to gain insights and identify trends. 
- Evaluated models via bootstrapping to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals.
